## Create Party

Welcome to the exciting world of liquidity and token creation! With the `Create Party`, you can effortlessly launch your very own liquidity party, complete with a fresh new token and an initial liquidity pool. Here’s how it works:

**What You’ll Do:**

1. **Create Your Token:** Define the name and symbol of your new ERC20 token. Whether you’re creating a new asset for fun or business, this step sets the foundation for your liquidity party.
2. **Set Up Your Liquidity Pool:** Instantly establish a liquidity pool where your new token will thrive. This is where the magic happens—creating a space for trading and liquidity.
3. **Get the Party Started:** Upon creation, the liquidity pool is linked to you, the party’s host, ensuring you’re recognized as the pioneer. If you contribute more than the required token creation fee, you get an extra boost by executing a swap.

        string calldata name, // Name of the new ERC20 token
        string calldata symbol // Symbol of the new ERC20 token
    ) external payable returns (IERC20 newToken);
```

Simply call the `createParty` function with the desired token **name** and **symbol**, provide the required BNB fee, and watch as your new token and liquidity pool come to life. Whether you’re aiming to create a new asset for your project or just want to explore the liquidity landscape, this function makes it all possible.

## Leave Party

Saying goodbye to the party? 😢 When you’re ready to exit, you can swap your tokens back to BNB and gracefully make your exit. Simply transfer your tokens to the contract, and it’ll handle the swap for you, ensuring you get the best value. While it’s a bit of a farewell, we’ll make sure your BNB is sent directly to your wallet, so you can leave from party.

```solidity
function leaveParty(
    address tokenIn,           // Address of the token the user wants to swap for BNB
    uint256 amountIn,         // Amount of the token to be swapped
    uint256 amountOutMinimum  // Minimum amount of BNB the user expects to receive from the swap
) external;

```
